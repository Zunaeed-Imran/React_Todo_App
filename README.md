# React + Vite

### what i lern in this project
- when we make function like onChange{} we make update or change by using `name` in the input field.
- an example 
```
   const handleChange = (event) => {
    const name = event.target.name;
    
  } 
  ``` 
- when we use child to parent data pass 'prop connect to another page varieble name' below example. 
- ` <New_todo addTodo={handleAddTodo} />` 'addTodo' is the variable i was talk about.
- we also take unique id in this project.
- if i don't pass (too.too) in the 'Todos.jsx' it show array not the value we input.
